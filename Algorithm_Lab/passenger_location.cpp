Q2. Locate from Passengers
On a bus, there are N number of passengers sitting on their seats ranging from 0 to N-1. Karim is looking for passengers whose ages are multiplicand of 4 and seats are within a specific range (X to Y), where both X and Y are inclusive. Now can you help Karim to solve his problem?

Input: In the first line you have to take an integer (N) which indicates total number of passengers. 
Next line you will take two space-separated integers (X  Y) which indicates the seat range.
Third line of input will take N space-separated integers indicating the ages of the passengers.

N.B: Seat number will count from 0 to N-1.
   
Sample input:
10
4 7
22 36 37 21 16 24 32 27 21 75

Sample output :
16 24 32
